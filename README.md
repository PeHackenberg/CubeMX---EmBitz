# EmBitz-guides
Some guides for EmBitz. I mostly use Embitz with CubeMX and STM32Fxxx MCUs.

  - How to port CubeMX projects to EMBitz. EmBitz is a great IDE and setting up STM32 projects via CubeMX is the easiest way, but CubeMX is not directly able to create EmBitz projects. [Manual for porting CubeMX Projects to EMBitz (Example for STM32F7)](Manual%20for%20porting%20CubeMX%20Projects%20to%20EMBitz%20(Example%20for%20STM32F7).pdf)
  
  - How to use STM32F746G-Discovery with EmBitz. The STLinkV2 embedded on the Discovery has an internal mass storage. The EmBitz STLink GDB server is not able to connect to these types of STLinks, but works perfectly with these cheap STLinkV2 clones from china. So I soldered some cables to the Discovery board, to use it with the chinese one. [STM32F746G-Discovery with chinese STLINKV2.pdf](STM32F746G-Discovery%20with%20chinese%20STLINKV2.pdf)
